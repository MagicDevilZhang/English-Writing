## 开头句

> 你为什么要提出这个方法？一般说过去的方法存在什么问题



通常采用如下方式

- 介绍背景，阐述问题，然后我们提出了一个新方法来解决问题。
- 什么方法对TaskA有效，我们想应用到TaskB。
- （开门见山）我们提出了一个新方法，为什么要提出呢？




| xx问题正面临一个困境，要么<质量好>，要么<可编辑性强>，我们提出的方法正好能同时实现。 |
| :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Existing** 3D-aware facial generation methods **face a dilemma** in quality **versus** editability: they either generate editable results in low resolution, or high quality ones with no editing flexibility. |
| In this work, we propose a new approach that **brings the best of both worlds together**. |

| Recently, xx **has achieved great empirical success**, especially …; **However, a key problem** of xx is that …; **It's necessary to** … |
| 3D-aware image synthesis aims to generate images of objects from multiple views by learning a 3D representation. **However, one key challenge remains**: **existing approaches lack** geometry constraints, hence usually fail to generate multi-view consistent images. |
| **We are witnessing an explosion** of neural implicit representations in computer vision and graphics. **Their applicability has recently expanded beyond tasks such as** xx. However, existing methods … **We introduce a new method that enables** xx. |
| **Despite the rapid advancement of** semantic discovery in the latent space of GANs, **existing approaches either are limited to** finding global attributes or … |



| 某技术或者领域在实现TaskA上已经做得很好了，但TaskB还不能很好解决 |
| :------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **While** generating realistic images **is no longer a difficult task**, producing the corresponding 3D structure such that they can be rendered from different views **is non-trivial**. |
| Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) **have recently demonstrated** photo- realistic results **for the task of** novel view synthesis. In this paper, we propose to **apply** novel view synthesis **to** the robot relocalization problem: [details] |
| However, such advancements have not been fully migrated to the community of xx. |



| 第一句直接说我们的名称，做了什么                             |
| :------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **We present a method for** learning a generative 3D model based on nerf, trained solely from data with only single views of each object. |

## 例子

### 融合式

While NeRF has shown great success for neural reconstruction and rendering, its limited MLP capacity and long per-scene optimization times make it challenging to model large-scale indoor scenes. In contrast, classical 3D reconstruction methods can handle large-scale scenes but do not produce realistic renderings. We propose NeRFusion, a method that combines the advantages of NeRF and TSDF-based fusion techniques to achieve efficient large-scale reconstruction and photo-realistic rendering.
